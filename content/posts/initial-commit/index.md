The first thing I can remember wanting to do as a job is write. 
It was probably on the back of getting a glowing report from my primary school teacher for my poem about a tiger.
I did end up writing for a living, but it ended up being of a more prosaic variety. 
The kind filled with algorithms and closures rather than similies and metaphors; I'm a software engineer.
<br/>
<br/>
Dreams of being a real writer floated away, but never fully evaporated.
I even applied for (and got) a job as a writer on a computing magazine after my first programming job.
I didn't take it though, due to a combination of the salary offer and my pragmatic / cowardly nature.
I would occasionally still try and write things, fragments of short stories litter my google drive, all terrible.
I would struggle through a few paragraphs, read them back, wince so hard my hair fell out, then slam my laptop shut and forget about it.
I've realised though, that if I want to one day be able to write something that doesn't make me cringe, then I'm going to have to practice.
<br/>
<br/>
So here we are then. I could just write in a journal or something, but I figured I would make like it was 2003 and get blogging.
I'm going to try and write _something_ at least once a week.
There is going to be no theme, it could be a simple diary entry, a book or film review, maybe even some fragments of fiction if I feel brave enough.
This is my 2025 goal, along with reading more, cycling more, sleeping more. We'll see what gives I guess.
